Established online marketplaces such as Amazon, eBay, and Best Buy are prominent competitors that provide a vast selection of DVDs, movie records, and video games. These platforms leverage their extensive reach and logistical capabilities to offer competitive pricing and a convenient shopping experience.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, streaming services like Netflix, Hulu, and Disney+ present a unique challenge, as they offer a vast digital library of movies and TV shows for online streaming. While they operate in a different format, they compete for customers' attention and leisure time, as they provide an alternative way to access entertainment content.&#10;&#10;To stay competitive in the e-commerce landscape, Neckfleck differentiates itself by focusing on the nostalgia and charm of physical media. The personalized customer service, curated collection of old movie records, and a blend of classic and contemporary titles in DVDs and video games are the unique aspects that set Genie's Video Store apart from its competitors. By offering a seamless online shopping experience, attentive customer service, and a diverse selection, Genie's Video Store aims to carve out its niche in the competitive e-commerce market." wrapText="true">
